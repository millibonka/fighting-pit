# fighting-pit
A simulation of fighting pits for Dungeons &amp; Dragons downtime.

A lot of ideas for future development and more features, but for now it works well for simulating extra fights in the fighting pit that don't involve the player characters. 

For testing use the Test.csv and give "Test" as the name for the fighting pit.
